hi, i don't really program much anymore, but i still use github to host the main page for all my [skins](https://github.com/TechnoSL/rc-osuskins/blob/master/skins.md) (and [tf2 hud too i suppose](https://github.com/TechnoSL/m0re_techno))

i also maintain [Middle Mann](https://github.com/Vexcenot/Middle-Mann/) lol
